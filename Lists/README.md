# Lists
## Singly Linked List
A singly linked list in it's simplest form is a collection of nodes that when strung together from a linear sequence. Each Node contains two data points: the specified data to store, and a reference to the next node in the list. The first and last nodes of the list are called the head and tail respectively. We keep a reference to the head and tail nodes to make other operations easier. We can traverse the list by starting at the head node and following each of the references along to the tail node.

### RunTime Complexity

| Operations | Running Time |
| ---------- | ------------ |
| Add to front | O(1)       |
| Add to end | O(1)         |
| Remove from start | O(1)  |
| Remove from end | O(n)    |

### Space Complexity

Space complexity is O(n) where n is the number of elements stored in the list.
